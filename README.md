# Telematics Integration in Auto Insurance

A comprehensive system for collecting, processing, and analyzing driving behavior data to provide usage-based insurance (UBI) pricing models.

## 🚗 Overview

This project implements a complete telematics-based auto insurance solution that:

- **Collects real-time driving data** through simulated telematics devices
- **Processes and analyzes** driving behavior patterns
- **Calculates dynamic risk scores** using machine learning algorithms
- **Adjusts insurance premiums** based on actual driving habits
- **Provides user dashboards** for transparency and engagement

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a microservice-oriented architecture with clear domain boundaries:

## 🏛️ Design Principles

This implementation follows engineering best practices for high-velocity development:

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Clear domain boundaries** with separate modules for each concern
- **Immutable value objects** for data representation
- **Entities with identity** for business objects
- **Services for behavior** that doesn't belong to entities

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible without modifying existing code
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Microservice Architecture
- **Bounded contexts** with clear interfaces
- **Independent deployability** of components
- **Event-driven communication** between services
- **Service-level observability**
